# CLSearchAssist
Craigslist custom search tool

This tool searches craigslist apartment listings via RSS, pulls valid listing URLs from the feed, and then
excludes listings you do not want based on specific words or phrases. Then after removing listings with excluded terms,
it writes all remaining items to your local disk to peruse.

I created this as a way to streamline apartment searching. Rather than constantly search Craigslist for listings, this
script can be run once or twice a day for results and prune out unwanted listings based on the criteria provided.
